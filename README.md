# Ray Tracing in One Weekend

Code I copied and wrote as I read along the Ray Tracing In One Weekend book.

Build using `make`, run using e.g. `./ray-tracer > ./imgs/ray-tracer.ppm` (the current render will take forever; reduce `cam.samples_per_pixel` to something much lower if you want more reasonable render times).

Images can be seen in the imgs folder.
